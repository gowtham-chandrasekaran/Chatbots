# Parrot Chatbot using Twilio ðŸ¦œ 
This is a simple chatbot that uses twilio to integrate with whatsapp and send same messages as soon as a user sends a message to the bot.

The app is deployed and hosted using <a href="https://id.heroku.com/login">heroku</a> which enables the program to keep running all the time even if our local computer is turned off.
